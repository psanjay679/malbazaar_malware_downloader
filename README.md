# Malware Downloader

This repo I have created to download malwares from https://bazaar.abuse.ch/ in bulk. All you have to do is provide tag and the limit (default is 10). Tags can be like dridex, qakbot, trickbot etc.

It will create directory with respective tagname provided and store all the samples into them. All the samples are password protected zip files with password "infected" as usual.


```
usage: python download.py <list of comma seperated tags> <download file limit>
```

Examples:

To download malwares from single tag with limit 10:

```
python3 download.py dridex 100
```

To download malwares from multiple tags

```
python3 download.py dridex,qakbot,trickbot
```
